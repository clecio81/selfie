## Selfie

Selfie is a simple command framework for selfbots and selfbots only. It uses a suffix rather than a prefix to command so keep that in mind.

This is currently undocumented, too lazy to add docs might later. To get a good idea on how to use framework look in tests.

To install selfie run `npm i -s digitronics/selfie`
